## How to identify the command line we are using?

Run below command to get the information:

```shell
echo $SHELL
```

On macOS 10.15 Catalina and later, the default Terminal shell switches from the bash to zsh.

- For bash shell, we can put the environment variables at ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc.
- For zsh shell, we can put the environment variables at ~/.zshenv or ~/.zshrc.
